# Linux-Addons-And-Programs
# OVERVIEW:
This includes my customizations and additional programs when booting Linux machines. 

# Notes
- This repo is a public, near-copy of a private repo that I regularly use. On an irregular basis, I copy over the changes from the private repo to this one, which is why my activity/contributions seem minimal here.
- The installation-related code (the linuxInit.sh and the code in the linuxBoot folder) have been minimally tested as of Sept 2024. All other files have been tested.
- This repo includes all the code from the Penetration Testing Automation repo. The purpose of having a separate repo for the pentesting code is to highlight it for recruiters and/or hiring managers who are reviewing my work.
- There are minimal comments on these files as of Sept 2024. It will be filled out in the future.
